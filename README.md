<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

Our hero, Walad, needs your help. He has so much to say and so much to do but he is having a hard time organizing and shaping(pun intended) his thoughts and words. We like you to help him to communicate his thoughts in a more stylistic and elastic manner.

To this end, we prepared a small and fun challenge for you. Please read the guidelines below and follow the instructions to complete the challenge.

<br />

## **Bubble Sort, Well sort of..**

<br />

### **Objective:**

In this call, we want you to design and implement a React library that will enable Walad to speak in bubbles and configure them as he wishes.

We have some important requirements for you to fulfill.
  
</br>

- The user should be able to input a string into a bubble.
> 
- Once the input is displayed in the bubble, the bubble should shrink by removing the whitespaces around the input.
> 
- By pressing and dragging the blue circle(which has an arrow on it), the user should be able to change the direction of the bubble's origin.
> 
- The user should be able to create multiple bubbles.
> 
- The user should be able to connect the bubbles using the blue circle. Make sure that the extremity of the parent bubble is connected to the child bubble.
> 
- Tapping on the bubble should 'select' the bubble for editing.
> 
- Bubbles should be able to move across the screen but they should be within the screen real estate without any overflows.
> 
- The user should be able to change the bubble's background color.
> 
- The user should be able to remove a bubble.
